# Intro

This _`PowerShell`_ script removes most of unnecessary and annoying Windows 10 applications and telemetry features.

Its currently under active development and feedback is greatly appreciated.

# Execution

1. Enable PowerShell execution `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force`
2. On the prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the files: for example `cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads`
3. To run the script, enter in the following and hit enter: `.\jwst_w10.ps1`
4. The excution process is in most of the times quite long depeding both on the system hardware and current state of the OS, the execution requires some choices so the whole execution should be monitored.
